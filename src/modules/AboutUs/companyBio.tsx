                        In the spirit of Public-Private Partnership (PPP), the
                        Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) in 2006
                        mandated the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria Export
                        Promotion Group (MANEG), to midwife the process of
                        setting up the first Nigerian Trade House company:

                      <article style={{ color: "#000" }}>
                        Activities Nexportrade expects to drive the process of
                        implementing an economic network that will facilitate,
                        promote, and sustain a business-friendly environment
                        amongst and between economic operators.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This process is expected to reinforce business and
                        investment relations between African Nations by
                        leveraging bilateral agreements, MoUs, and protocols
                        entered between sister Nations.
                        <br />
                        <br /> It aims to lead to the actualization of
                        cooperation through the integration of businesses and
                        people in the field using protocols designed by
                        policymakers and ratified by political leaders at
                        regional and continental levels.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Additionally, the Nexportrade initiative will indirectly
                        address the loss of government revenue arising from the
                        volume of informal trade in sub-Saharan Africa and avail
                        Governments, policymakers and development partners with
                        the opportunity to obtain credible trade statistics
                        needed to capture economic trends for decision-making
                        processes as well as for effective planning for national
                        development and attainment of the MDGs.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We expect similar trade hubs to be established in
                        the ECOWAS member states and elsewhere in Africa. These
                        business hubs will be patterned along the Nigerian model
                        to boost the volume of intra-African trade and ensure a
                        seamless investment climate. Our competencies and areas
